Welcome to the repository for my AP Research project, "Creating a Stacked Ensemble Regressor to Predict Student Attendance."

**For a video tutorial of how to run the files (the same information is outlined below) go to the following link:** https://youtu.be/4tByS7O9KlI

To begin, download python at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once that's done run the following commands in your terminal:

  - python -m pip install -U pip
  - python -m pip install -U matplotlib
  - pip install numpy
  - pip install pandas
  - pip install seaborn
  - pip install -U scikit-learn

Next clone the repository or download _**Heatmap.py, KNNGridSearch.py, and Stacked Regression Ensemble.py**_ in the same folder as the student data, name the student data "StudentData.csv," and run each respective file in the terminal. 
Lastly, just send me the three outputs of those files: KNN Grid Search.png, Feature Correlation Heatmap.png, and Error Metrics.csv 

_**IMPORTANT**_: THE REAL DATA FILE MUST BE NAMED "StudentData.csv" IF THIS IS NOT DONE THE FILES WILL NOT RUN
